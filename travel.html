    <h2>Getting Here</h2>

    <p>Our exclusive resort is located in the glorious and remote mountains
      of catistan. This natural setting lets our guests enjoy themselves away
      from the hubub of the dog-eat-dog-world. Unfortunately this can make
      getting here a bit of a process. From Seattle:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Fly to Catistan (Alaska has indirect flights monthly)</li>
      <li>Hire a car up tabby mountain</li>
      <li>We are five miles past kitty junction</li>
    </ol>
